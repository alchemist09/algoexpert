/**
 * Given an empty plot of size 2 x n. We want to place tiles such that the plot is
 * entirely covered. Each tile is of size 2 x 1 and can either be placed vertically
 * or horizontally. If n is 5, then on way to over the plot is show in the second
 * diagram below.
 * 
 * Write a function that accepts n as input and returns the total number of ways
 * in which we can place the tiles (without breaking the tiles).

  (a) Empty plot

   (b) Tiles places in plot

    Solution

Let us define recursion. We can place the tile either horizontally or vertically.

1. If we place the first tile vertically, then the problem reduces to:
   Number of ways tiles can be placed on a plot of size 2 * (n-1)

  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
  |\\|  |  |  |  |
  - - - - - - - - 
  |\\|  |  |  |  |
  - - - - - - - - 
     |<-- n-1 -->|

2. If we place the first tile horizontally, then the second tile must also be 
   placed horizontally. The problem then reduces to :
   Number of ways tiles can be placed on a plot of size 2 * (n-2)

   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
  |\\\\\|  |  |  |
  - - - - - - - - 
  |\\\\\|  |  |  |
  - - - - - - - - 
        |<- n-2 >|


In both cases we define the large problem in terms of smaller subproblems of the
same type. This is recursion. Recursion also has two terminating conditions, which
are: 
    If n == 1, there is just on possible way:
      - place one tile vertically
    If n == 2, there are two possible ways:
      - place both tiles vertically
      - place both tiles horizontally
