/**
 A subsequence of a string S is a set of characters that appear in the string
 in left-to-right order, but not necessarily consecutively. For example, if 
 string is ACTTGCG, 
      then, ACT, ATTC, T, ACTTCG are all subsequences
      but TTA is not a subsequence of the string

 A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence such that it's a subsequence
 of both strings. A longest common subsequence (LCS) is a common subsequence of
 maximal length
