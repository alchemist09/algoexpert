/**
 * Find the length of longest substring of a given string of digits, such
 * that sum of digits in first half and second half  of the substring is same.
 * Example:
 *       Input: 142124
 *       Output: 6
 * 
 * The whole string is the answer, because sum of first three digits = sum of last
 * three digits (1+4+2 = 1+2+4)
 * 
 *      Input:  9430723
 *      Output: 4
 * 
 * longest substring with first and second half having equal sum is "4307".
