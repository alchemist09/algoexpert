/**
 String C is said to be an intervleaving of string A and B if it contains all
 the characters from A and B, and the relative order of characters of both of 
 the strings is preserved in C. For example:
      A = xyz
      B = abcd
      C = xabyczd (intervleaving of A and B)

      A = bcc
      B = bbca
      C = bbcbcac (intervleaving of A and B)
