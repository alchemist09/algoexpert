/**
 * There are N stations in a route, starting from 0 to N-1. A train moves from 
 * station (0) to the last station (N-1) in only forward direction. The cost of
 * ticket between any two station is given. Find the minimum cost of travel between
 * station (0) to station (N-1)
 * 
 * ***************************************************************************
 * **************************** SOLUTION *************************************
 * ***************************************************************************
 *
 * First you define data structure in which cost of ticket between stations is 
 * stored. If we have four stations (0 to 3), and the cost of ticket is stored
 * in a 4 * 4 matrix as below
 * 
 *    cost[][] = {
 *      {0, 10, 75, 94},
 *      {-1, 0, 35, 50},
 *      {-1, -1, 0, 80},
 *      {-1, -1, -1, 0}
 *    } 
 * 
 * cost[i][j] is cost of station from station i to station j. Since we are not
 * moving backwards, cost[i][j] does not make sense when i > j, and hence they 
 * are all -1. If i==j, then we are at the same station where we want to go,
 * therefore all the diagonal elements are zeros.
 * 
 * If we want to move from station-0 to station-2, the cheapest way is to take 
 * the ticket of station-1 from station-0, then the ticket of station-2 from 
 * station-1. This way the total cost of travel is USD45(10+35). If we take the
 * direct ticket of station-2 from station-0, then the cost of travel is USD75.
 * 
 * If minCost(s, d) is the minimum cost of travelling from station-s to station-d,
 * the minimum cost to reach N-1 from 0 can be recursively defined as 
 * 
 *         minCost(0, N-1) {
 *            MIN {
 *              cost[0][N-1],
 *              minCost(0, 2) + minCost(2, N-1),
 *              ... ... ... ...,
 *              minCost(0, N-2) + cost[N-2][N-1]
 *            } 
 *         }
 * 
 * First option is to go directly to station N-1 from station-0 without any break.
 * Second option is to break at station-i and so on. When we break at station-i, 
 * we calculate the minimum cost of moving from 0-i, and then the minimum cost of
 * moving from i to N-1.

/**
 *    USING BOTTOM-UP DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH TO CALCULATE THE MINIMUM COST
 * 
 * This approach first calculates the minimum cost for station-0, then station-1, 
 * then station-2 and so on. The costs are stored in a one-dimensional array 
 * minCost[n]. Minimum cost to reach station-0 is zero, since we are already there.
 *    
 *     minCost[0] = 0
 * 
 * Minimum cost to reach station-1 is minCost[1] = cost[0][1], since that's the
 * only way to reach station-1.
 * 
 *    minCost[1] = cost[0][1]
 * 
 * Minimum cost to reach station-2 is minimum of below two values, (Either go 
 * directly to station-2 or take a break at station-1 then proceed from station-1
 * to station-2).
 * 
 *    1. minCost[0] + cost[0][2]
 *    2. minCost[1] + cost[1][2]
 * 
 * Note that minCost[i] is a lookup in cache and cost is a lookup in cost array.
 * Similarly minimum cost to reach station-3 is minimum of below three values,
 * 
 *    1. Go to station-3 directly
 *          minCost[0] + cost[0][3]
 *    2. Go to station-1, then from there go to station-3 directly
 *          minCost[1] + cost[1][3]
 *    3. Go to station-2 (minimum cost already computed) then go to station-3
 *          minCost[2] + cost[2][3]
 * 
 * When we break at station-2, we are using the already computed minimum cost
 * of going from station-0 to station-2, and adding the actual cost of going directly 
 * from station-2 to station-3 (observe optimal substructure)
 * 
 * Using this approach we end up with a runtime of O(n^2) and O(n) space
